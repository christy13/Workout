Workout is a Rails site designed to help people find others to work out with. 
Users can create their own events or join existing ones.

Workout utilizes Google Calendar for keeping track of events. Private messages
can be sent between members of a group, and users can choose to display their 
name, course, and bio publically or just for members of the event that he or she 
joins.
